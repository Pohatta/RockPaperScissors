# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Just a demo using react & node


## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Project includes front and backend which need to be installed separately

1. Download / Clone repository
2. Navigate to back (backend) and run

```
npm install
```

3. Navigate to front end and run

```
npm install
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Notes

This demo includes no test or production stuff. Just my local dev thingies.
