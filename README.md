## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Project includes front and backend which need to be installed separately

1. Download / Clone repository
2. Navigate to back (backend) and run

```
npm install
```

3. Navigate to front end and run

```
npm install
```
Then start both servers with

```
npm start
```

That's all!

## Notes

This demo includes no test or production stuff. Just my local dev thingies.
